What happened, Captain? Needing directions?
All those fights against those aliens must have made you tired...
It goes like this:
	-You move with the 'arrow keys'
	-Shoot by holding 'x'
	-Activate your ship special ability by pressing 'c'
That's the basic!
Be careful not to shoot for a long time!
This will overheat the systems and you won't be able to shoot for a while (10 seconds, I think)!
The same goes to the special ability.
After using it, you must wait 10 seconds to use it again.
Rest assured! If by any chance you are hit, we will teleport port you to one of the reserve ship.
We don't have many of those, so be careful...
Also, be sure to catch anything dropped by those aliens, something might be usefull (like weapons or upgrades).
Well, that's it.
Let's depart whenever you are ready!
