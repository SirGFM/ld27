What happened, Captain? Needing directions?
All those fights against those aliens must have made you tired...
It goes like this:
	-You move with the 'arrow keys'
	-Shoot by holding 'x'
That's the basic!
Rest assured! If by any chance you are hit, we will teleport port you to one of the reserve ship.
We don't have many of those, so be careful...
Also, be sure to catch anything dropped by those aliens, something might be usefull (like weapons or upgrades).
Well, that's it.
Let's depart whenever you are ready!
